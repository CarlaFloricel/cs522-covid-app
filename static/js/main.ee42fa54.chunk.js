The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u2018CO\u2019 stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 \u2018VI\u2019 for \u2018virus,\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d.There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.

It spreads through respiratory droplets or small particles, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. These particles can be inhaled into the nose, mouth, airways, and lungs and cause infection. This is thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Droplets can also land on surfaces and objects and be transferred by touch. A person may get COVID-19 by touching the surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. Spread from touching surfaces is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. It is possible that COVID-19 may spread through the droplets and airborne particles that are formed when a person who has COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. There is growing evidence that droplets and airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond 6 feet (for example, during choir practice, in restaurants, or in fitness classes). In general, indoor environments without good ventilation increase this risk.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Spread","question":"Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?","reply":"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Spread","question":"What is community spread?","reply":"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear masks in public settings. Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people. The masks recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wear-cloth-face-coverings.html"},{"type":"Prevention","question":"Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?","reply":"It is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness. Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you. Have at least a 2-week supply of all prescription and non-prescription medications. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations are up-to-date. Call your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your medical conditions, or if you get sick. to find out about different ways you can connect with your healthcare provider for chronic disease management or other conditions. Do not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or any health condition that requires immediate attention. If you need emergency help, call 911.

Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Prevention","question":"Is it okay for me to donate blood?","reply":"In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Prevention","question":"Should contact lenses wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?","reply":"Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers. Contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses. People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/index.html"},{"type":"Prevention","question":"Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19?","reply":"Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19. For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus. Always use solution to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present. Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Prevention","question":"Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?","reply":"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Prevention","question":"What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?","reply":"Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.  If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and are not tested, it is important to stay home. What to do if you are sick. COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your state or localexternal icon health department\u2019s website to look for the latest local information on testing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized viral tests that let you collect either a nasal swabexternal icon or a saliva sampleexternal icon at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis. If you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take if you are sick or caring for someone. If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. This means you could still spread the virus. If you develop symptoms later, you might need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html"},{"type":"Testing","question":"How can I get tested for a past infection (antibody test) and what does my test mean?","reply":"Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide some protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last. Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection have been reported, but remain rare. You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again. If you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html"},{"type":"Testing","question":"Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?","reply":"Yes, it is possible.

For information, see MIS-C.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Children","question":"Can my child hang out with their friends during the pandemic?","reply":"The more people your child interacts with, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. While your child may spend time with other people when they return to childcare or school settings, reducing the number of people your child interacts with outside people within your household, childcare facility or school can reduce the risk of getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC recommends children 2 years of age and older wear a mask in public settings or when around people who do not live in their household, especially when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet from others. However, masks should not be a substitute for other preventive measures such as frequent hand washing and staying at least 6 feet away from others.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"type":"Children","question":"Can mu child spend time with older adults and people with chronic medical conditions?","reply":"Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19. If you live with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider separating your child from them if your child has frequent interactions with those outside the household (like at schools or other settings). Consider postponing visits or trips to see grandparents, older family members, or family members with underlying medical conditions while there are high levels of transmission (or high number of COVID-19 cases) in your community. If your child does visit someone who is older or has an underlying medical condition that puts that them at risk of severe illness, your child should stay at least 6 feet away from that person. If your child is 2 years or older, he or she should also wear a mask.

What additional steps should my family take?","reply":"People of any age who have certain underlying medical conditions might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick, families can take steps recommended for children with underlying conditions.  Consider identifying potential alternative caregivers, in case you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers should not be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 For more information, see Sick Parents and Caregivers. Make sure these caregivers take extra precautions if your child has a disability.  If your child receives any support care services in the home, such as services from personal care attendants, direct support professionals, or therapists, make plans for what you will do if your child\u2019s direct care providers or anyone in your family gets sick.

Someone from the health department may call you to Check on your health, Discuss who you have been around, and ask where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. If your test is negative and you don\u2019t have symptoms, you should continue to stay home and self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. This is important because symptoms can appear up to 14 days after you\u2019ve been exposed and are infected. A negative result before the end of your quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. Additionally, you do not need a repeat test unless you develop symptoms, or if you require a test to return to work. If your test is negative and you have symptoms, you should continue to self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. Additional medical consultation and a second test may be needed if your symptoms do not improve.","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"}]')},245:function(e,t,n){},250:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t);var
